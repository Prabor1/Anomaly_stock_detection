# Anomaly_stock_detection

Here I detected anomaly in stock prediction. After some simple data preprocessing, I build a LSTM AutoEncoder. After training it for 15 epochs I got a loss of `0.0278` on val set. Then I plotted the result i.e. val loss against epochs. Finally I plotted the result from my trained model, which almost detect the anomaly perfectly.     
The source code in python is available in the notebook. The dataset is also added.
